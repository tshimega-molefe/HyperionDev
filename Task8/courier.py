# We're trying to calculate the cost of sending a parcel for a courier company.
# The variables to consider are:
# Distance
# Freight
# Insurance
# Gift
# Priority
# Parcel

# Create an algorithm using these variables to find the total cost, stored as
# total_cost = freight + insurance + gift + priority + parcel

# Request the distance

distance = str(input("Enter the total distance of the delivery in kilometers: "))
