Here are some non-functional requirements, taking into account the identified ambiguities and omissions:

Security Requirements:

The system shall encrypt all credit card and personal identification data during transmission and storage.
The system shall implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can access and use the ticket-issuing system.

Credit card validation shall include checks for card number validity, expiration date, and available funds.


Error Handling Requirements:

The system shall provide informative error messages for users in case of input errors or system failures.
In the event of a payment failure, the system shall not issue a ticket and shall inform the user of the failure.
