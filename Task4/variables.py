# Create four variables, each being one of the four variable types, namely string, integer, float, and boolean.

# For type string, define a snake_case variable name that is descriptive of the value to be assigned to the variable
# For type integer, define a snake_case variable name that is descriptive of the value to be assigned to the variable
# For type float, define a snake_case variable name that is descriptive of the value to be assigned to the variable
# For type boolean, define a snake_case variable name that is descriptive of the value to be assigned to the variable
