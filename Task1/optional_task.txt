An algorithm that asks the user to enter four numbers, sorts those numbers from smallest to largest and then prints the sorted numbers

Initialize an empty array called numbers = []

For the index i = 1 to 4

Request from the user to input 4 numbers, set to inputNumber

    print("Please enter 4 numbers") set to input

    input numbers[i]

Sorting the numbers

For the index i = 1 to 3

    Create another index j

        For index j = 1 to 4 - i

            if numbers[j] is greater than numbers[j + 1] then

                swap numbers[j] and numbers[j + 1]

print("Sorted Numbers:"
    For the index i = 1 to 4
        print(numbers[i])
)
