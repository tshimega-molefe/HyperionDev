An algorithm that asks a user to enter a positive number repeatedly until the user enters a zero value, then determines and outputs the largest of the numbers that were input:

Set the largestNumber variable to zero

Repeatedly request from the user to input either a positive number, or zero 

If the input number is greater than the largestNumber variable

    print("Enter a positive number or zero")

    set the largestNumber variable to the input number

If the number is equal to zero

    no longer show the user the initial prompt, and instead,

    print("The largest of the number entered is:", largestNumber)

An algorithm that reads an arbitrary number of integers and then returns their arithmetic average:

Set the sumOfNumbers to 0

Set the countOfNumbers to 0

Repeatedly request from the user to input an integer

    print("Please enter an integer")

    set the inputNumber to the input number by the user

If the inputNumber is an integer

        set the sumOfNumbers = sumOfNumbers + inputNumber

        iterate the countOfNumbers by 1; executing the formula, countOfNumbers = countOfNumbers + 1

If the input number is not an integer

    print("Oops that was incorrect, please enter an integer")

Set the arithmeticAverage = sumOfNumbers divided(/) by countOfNumbers

    print("The arithmetic average is: " arithmeticAverage)

An algorithm that reads a grocery list and prints out the products (in alphabetical order) that are still left to buy

Initialize an empty array called groceryList = []

Repeatedly request from the user to input a string set to the variable groceryItem

    print("Please enter a grocery list item or the text `Done` if you're done adding items to the list.")

    set the groceryItem equal to = input string by the user ("Enter a grocery item (or 'done' to finish adding items): ")

If groceryItem does not equal != "Done"

        add groceryItem string to groceryList array

If groceryItem == "Done"

    sort the items within the grocery list array `groceryList[]` in alphabetical order 

    print("Your grocery list is:" groceryList )

print("Remaining items to buy:")

    For each item in the groceryList[]

    print("groceryItem)
