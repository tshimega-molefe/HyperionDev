An algorithm that asks a user to enter a positve number repeatedly until the user enters a zero value, then determines and outputs the largest of the numbers that were input:

Set the largestNumber variable to zero

Initialize an empty array of name enteredNumbers

Request a positve number, or zero from the user

If the number is greater than zero

    print "Enter a positive number or zero"

    append the number entered by the user into the enteredNumbers array

If the number is equal to zero

    search for the max value within the enteredNumbers array

    mutate the value of the largestNumber value to equal the max value of the enteredNumbers array

    print "largestNumber"
