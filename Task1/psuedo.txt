An algorithm that asks a user to enter a positive number repeatedly until the user enters a zero value, then determines and outputs the largest of the numbers that were input:

Set the largestNumber variable to zero

Repeatedly request from the user to input either a positive number, or zero 

If the input number is greater than the largestNumber variable

    print "Enter a positive number or zero"

    set the largestNumber variable to the input number

If the number is equal to zero

    no longer show the user the initial prompt, and instead,

    print "The largest of the number entered is:", largestNumber variable
