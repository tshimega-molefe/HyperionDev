An algorithm that asks a user to enter a positive number repeatedly until the user enters a zero value, then determines and outputs the largest of the numbers that were input:

Set the largestNumber variable to zero

Repeatedly request from the user to input either a positive number, or zero 

If the input number is greater than the largestNumber variable

    print("Enter a positive number or zero")

    set the largestNumber variable to the input number

If the number is equal to zero

    no longer show the user the initial prompt, and instead,

    print("The largest of the number entered is:", largestNumber)

An algorithm that reads an arbitrary number of integers and then returns their arithmetic average:

Set the sumOfNumbers to 0

Set the countOfNumbers to 0

Repeatedly request from the user to input an integer

    print("Please enter an integer")

    set the inputNumber to the input number by the user

If the inputNumber is an integer

        set the sumOfNumbers = to sumOfNumbers + inputNumber

        iterate the countOfNumbers by 1; executing the formula, countOfNumbers = countOfNumbers + 1

If the input number is not an integer

    print("Oops that was incorrect, please enter an integer")

Set the arithmeticAverage = to the sumOfNumbers divided by the countOfNumbers

    print("The arithmetic average is: " + arithmeticAverage)
